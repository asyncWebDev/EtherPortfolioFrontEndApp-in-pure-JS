# EtherPortfolioFrontEndApp-in-pure-JS

### This is the first unfinished alpha version of ethereum protfolio manager. 
It allows you to display any ethereum address portfolio content.
Thanks to the use of the charts.js library, it is possible to view the price of a token on a chart when clicking on a wallet item. 
The ethers.js library allows you to transfer ether token to another wallet, while for it to work you need to use a provider to connect to an ethereum node. To start you need to: 

Use <a href="https://www.infura.io/" target="_blank">INFURA</a> which is your provider ID. 

You need a <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">metamask wallet</a> to make the transfer (currently the supported network is the Goerli test network). Beware of scams! Enter only through the link provided in the README file. To see Goerli's test network you have to go to "Advanced" and "Show test networks" in the settings. 

You can use <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" target="_blank">goerli faucet</a> or message me on telegram @asyncWebDev or on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Movrhusar" target="_blank">@Movrhusar</a> to get test ethers.

To use the <a href="https://www.covalenthq.com/" target="_blank">Covalent API</a> you need to create an account on their site. 

You can provide all keys to the config file.
The project is still in the deep development phase.
