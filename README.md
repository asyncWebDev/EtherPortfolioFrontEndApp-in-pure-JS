# EtherPortfolioFrontEndApp-in-pure-JS

Ethereum portfolio tracker 
allows you to display any ethereum address portfolio content.
Thanks to the use of the charts.js library, it's possible to view the price of a token on a chart when clicking on a wallet item. 
The ethers.js library allows you to transfer ether token to another wallet.

!!! To use the main functionalities of the application you don't need metamask wallet and test ether (you only need them to make transactions), start with Covalent key to use address tracking !!!

To use the <a href="https://www.covalenthq.com/" target="_blank">Covalent API</a> you need to create an account on their site. 

<br />

### To make transactions:

You need a <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">metamask wallet</a> to make a transfer (currently the supported network is Goerli test network). Beware of scams! Enter only through the link provided in the README file. To see Goerli test network you have to use "Advanced" and "Show test networks" in the settings. 

You can use <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" target="_blank">goerli faucet</a> or message me on telegram @asyncWebDev or on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Movrhusar" target="_blank">@Movrhusar</a> to get test ethers.

<br />

### You can provide all keys to the config file.
